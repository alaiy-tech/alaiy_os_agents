"""Bulk enrichment: many products, still one OS Agent Run each.

The engine in alaiy_os runs exactly one product per Run, and this does not change
that — a batch is a fan-out over it. The rows of a Listing Bulk Enrich are split
into chunks of `batch_size`, one background job per chunk, and each job walks its
rows in order: create the Run, then execute it in-process through core's
``run_queued``. So every product keeps its own run history, output, transcript and
token counts, exactly as a single enrichment does.

Chunks rather than one job per product on purpose: 200 products would otherwise put
200 jobs on the shared `long` queue and starve everything else on it. Chunk count is
the parallelism knob, chunk size the per-job length.

Ordering matters in here. ``run_queued`` commits as it goes and calls
``frappe.db.rollback()`` on failure, so this module never holds a dirty batch
document across a product — row state is written with ``frappe.db.set_value`` and
committed *before* the run starts.

## Nothing here names a channel

The batch carries one, and everything channel-specific is read off that channel's
adapter: which doctype holds an enriched listing (for `skip_enriched`), and whether
there is an image step to wait for at all. A channel that declares neither still
runs — it simply has nothing to skip and nothing to wait on. See `channels.py`.
