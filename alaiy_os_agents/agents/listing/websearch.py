"""
The listing agent's one route to the public web: finding the same product on a
competitor's site and reading what it says there, for catalog-level specs a
supplier's own data and photos don't carry.

Both tools go through Alaiy OS core's `ai_client` seam like everything else this
agent does — `search_competitor_listings` via `llm.web_search`, the same
provider-agnostic call `chat/websearch.py` uses for Ask Alaiy. `view_page` has no
such seam to go through: fetching and reading a page is not a model capability,
so it is plain `requests` plus a stdlib HTML strip, the same way `tools.py`
fetches an external image itself rather than trusting the model to.

## Why this is agent-level and not a channel handler

Nothing here is knowledge about a marketplace. Reading a competitor's spec page
is the same act whether the listing being written is for Shopify or Amazon, so
there is no adapter to dispatch through and no `channels.resolve` call below —
these are the only tools in this agent that skip it.

What a channel *does* own is what to make of the result. `research_record` is
the seam for that: a channel's `save_listing` can read back what this run really
fetched and attribute its values against it, which is what the Shopify channel's
`provenance.py` does. Keeping the record here rather than in the channel is what
lets a second channel do the same without reimplementing the tools.
